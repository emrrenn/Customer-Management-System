# Patient Recording System 
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>

## Description

- This is a GUI based patient recording system used with sqlite database.

I wanted to create a basic patient recording system for my family company, based on audiology. The audiologist of the company takes the patients information and fills a form. It is really hard and redundant to keep track of these forms after there are hundreds, thousands of forms.

I used a python UI-library called [customtkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter), which is a modern version of the built-in tkinter library.
